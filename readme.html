<h1>UARTDRV bare metal application</h1>
<p>This example project demonstrates use of the UARTDRV driver with LEUART
in a bare metal application.</p>
<p>The application will echo back any characters it receives over the
serial connection. The use of LEUART with DMA allows the device to
enter deep sleep mode EM2.</p>
<p>Note that the baudrate of the serial connection is limited to 9600.
For instructions on using the virtual COM port, please refer to
the device's User's Guide.</p>
